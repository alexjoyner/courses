				<h2>Here's a time line of Dr.Borlaug's Life</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
					<li>
						<b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of
						Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National
						Youth Administration"
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in
						the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
						how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry
						Service
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off
						due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to
						school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
						pest-resistent plants.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor
						attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work
						on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
						applied science.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves
						behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
						pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
						different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
						varieties for each major climate on Earth.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season,
						doubling wheat yields
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
						high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well
						to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of
						wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass
						starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
					</li>
					<li><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
					<li>
						<b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase
						their maize and sorghum yields
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M
						University
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply
						by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we
						can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
						crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
						modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called
						it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
					</li>
					<li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
